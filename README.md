    3- Minify css

    4- Optimize the main.js file by 

        - changing the position of (var pizzasDiv = document.getElementById("randomPizzas")) and moive from within a loop
        - changing the number of pizza background row images 

    5- Optimize the pizza.html file by using bootstrap grid classes and also by removing the css attribute height from certain images.
